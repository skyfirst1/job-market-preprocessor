## Quick Start

### Method 1: Portable Release (Recommended · No Python Required)

1. Go to **[Latest Releases](https://github.com/shanliuling/WxArticleSaver/releases/latest)** and download the latest `WxArticleSaver-*-Windows-x64.zip`.
2. Extract to any folder and double-click **`WxArticleSaver.exe`**.

---

### Method 2: Run from Source (For Developers)

#### 1. Requirements
- Windows 10 / 11
- Python 3.11 or 3.12

#### 2. Start
After downloading the source code, double-click:

```text
install_and_run.bat
```

On first run, WxArticleSaver automatically installs required dependencies and temporarily trusts a locally generated CA certificate for the **current Windows user**.

---

### macOS Experimental Support (Run from Source)

The macOS implementation is currently a source-run PoC and does not provide a signed or notarized `.app`. It uses a macOS network-service PAC file to route only the WeChat article/media allowlist through local `mitmproxy`.

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
./run_macos.command --service "Wi-Fi"
```

On first launch, import the generated CA into the current user's `Login` Keychain and set it to `Always Trust`. Then fully quit and reopen WeChat for Mac; if the button does not appear, press `⌘R`. Press `Ctrl+C` in the launcher terminal to stop. If the process is interrupted, run `restore_proxy_macos.command`.

See [`docs/macos.md`](./docs/macos.md) for setup, security notes, troubleshooting, and limitations.

### 3. Export an Article (Common Steps)

1. Start WxArticleSaver, then fully quit WeChat and reopen it.
2. Open an Official Account article that you can normally access.
3. Click **"Export Article"** in the bottom-right corner.
4. If the button does not appear, press **Ctrl+R** or use **Right-click → Refresh** on the article page.
5. If the article contains video, play it for a few seconds before exporting.

Exported files are saved to:

```text
exports/
└─ Article Title/
   ├─ article.md
   ├─ article.html
   ├─ article.txt
   ├─ raw_wechat_response.html
   ├─ meta.json
   ├─ images/
   └─ videos/
```

## Why Is a Refresh Sometimes Needed?

WeChat for Windows may restore an already opened article directly from its WebView page cache. In that case, the article's main HTML is not requested again, so WxArticleSaver has no chance to inject the export button.

When it can confirm that WeChat is the foreground window, the program will **try to send Ctrl+R automatically once**. If that does not happen, refresh the page manually.

## Video Notes

Video URLs are often not present in the initial article HTML. It is recommended to play the video for a few seconds first, so the page requests the media resource before exporting.

## Security Design

WxArticleSaver uses a local `mitmproxy` instance to read and modify WeChat article HTTPS responses. On first run, it therefore needs to temporarily trust a **CA generated locally on your own machine** in the current user's certificate store.

## FAQ

### The "Export Article" button does not appear

Press **Ctrl+R** on the current article page, or use **Right-click → Refresh**. This is usually caused by WeChat's WebView page cache.

### Network settings are not restored after exit

Run:

```text
restore_proxy.bat
```

### How do I remove the root certificate installed by WxArticleSaver?

Run:

```text
remove_certificate.bat
```
