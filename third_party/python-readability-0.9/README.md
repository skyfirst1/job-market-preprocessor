# python-readability

Given an HTML document, extract and clean up the main body text and title.

This is a Python port of a Ruby port of [arc90's Readability project](https://web.archive.org/web/20130519040221/http://www.readability.com/).

## Installation

It's easy using `pip`, just run:

```bash
$ pip install readability-lxml
```

As an alternative, you may also use conda to install, just run:

```bash
$ conda install -c conda-forge readability-lxml
```

## Usage

```python
>>> import requests
>>> from readability import Document

>>> response = requests.get('http://example.com')
>>> doc = Document(response.content)
>>> print(doc.title())
Example Domain

>>> print(doc.summary())
<html><body><div><body id="readabilityBody">
<div>
    <h1>Example Domain</h1>
<p>This domain is established to be used for illustrative examples in documents. You may
use this domain in examples without prior coordination or asking for permission.</p>
    <p><a href="http://www.iana.org/domains/example">More information...</a></p>
</div>
</body>
</div></body></html>
```

The command-line interface accepts a local HTML file or a URL:

```bash
python -m readability -u https://example.com
```

Run the real-page extraction benchmark with the default minimum F1 of 0.95:

```bash
make benchmark
BENCHMARK_MIN_SCORE=0.97 make benchmark
```

The corpus methodology, version reports, and ten-engine comparison are
documented in
[`docs/quality/`](https://github.com/buriy/python-readability/blob/master/docs/quality/README.md).

## Security

`Document.summary()` removes common active content while extracting an article,
but readability-lxml is not a security boundary or a general-purpose HTML
sanitizer. Applications that render untrusted output must apply a dedicated
allowlist sanitizer and an appropriate Content Security Policy.

## Change Log
- 0.9
  - Expanded the declared Python range through 3.14, added `lxml` 6 support, and updated packaging metadata for Markdown documentation and current `cssselect` releases.
  - Added `python -m readability` execution for local files and URLs.
  - Fixed bytes input and encoding detection.
  - Fixed `get_clean_html()` before another API call has initialized the document.
  - Fixed shortened-title selection and CJK title length handling.
  - Fixed XPath annotations incorrectly affecting the ruthless-parser retry length.
  - Preserved inline links and formatting elements when converting misused `<div>` elements into paragraphs.
  - Removed inline `display: none`, `visibility: hidden`, HTML `hidden`, and `<noscript>` fallback content before scoring.
  - Preserved content containers whose class or ID also contains an unlikely-candidate term such as `sidebar`.
  - Preserved code blocks and semantic `<main>` or `<article>` containers during unlikely-candidate filtering.
  - Recovered editorial leads, heading preambles, split article segments, and substantial list-based articles.
  - Removed trailing linked calls to action without weakening general link-density filtering.
  - Restricted retained video iframes to exact HTTP(S) YouTube and Vimeo hosts, preventing lookalike-host and userinfo URL bypasses, and removed active `srcdoc` content.
  - Added 181 reproducible fixtures: 166 quality fixtures split into base, Dragnet, GitHub user-issue, and complete 130-page Mozilla Readability corpora, plus 15 manually curated real-page regression fixtures from `jcharum/lxml-readability`.
  - Replaced the unmaintained nose test runner with pytest in local, tox, and GitHub Actions workflows.
  - Updated development and release targets for portable module execution, PEP 517 builds, version synchronization, isolated artifact checks, and current-version uploads.
  - Improved the 166-page benchmark from precision 0.971, recall 0.884, and F1 0.926 in 0.8.4.1 to precision 0.991, recall 0.956, and F1 0.973.
  - Corrected the README usage examples.
  - Fixes GitHub issues [#14](https://github.com/buriy/python-readability/issues/14), [#108](https://github.com/buriy/python-readability/issues/108), [#119](https://github.com/buriy/python-readability/issues/119), [#130](https://github.com/buriy/python-readability/issues/130), [#143](https://github.com/buriy/python-readability/issues/143), [#146](https://github.com/buriy/python-readability/issues/146), [#153](https://github.com/buriy/python-readability/issues/153), [#158](https://github.com/buriy/python-readability/issues/158), [#159](https://github.com/buriy/python-readability/issues/159), [#163](https://github.com/buriy/python-readability/issues/163), [#170](https://github.com/buriy/python-readability/issues/170), [#176](https://github.com/buriy/python-readability/issues/176), [#182](https://github.com/buriy/python-readability/issues/182), and [#194](https://github.com/buriy/python-readability/issues/194). Release tracking issue [#196](https://github.com/buriy/python-readability/issues/196) can be closed after 0.9 is published to PyPI.
